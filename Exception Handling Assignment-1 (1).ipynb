    "Custom exceptions encourage consistent error-handling practices and can be shared across modules or projects, promoting code reusability.\n",
    "#### Enhanced Code Documentation:\n",
    "Clear exception names act as self-documenting elements, providing insights into potential error scenarios and facilitating code understanding.\n",
    "#### Precise Error Reporting: \n",
    "Custom exceptions enable you to generate detailed error messages, providing valuable information to users or administrators and aiding in bug fixing.\n",
